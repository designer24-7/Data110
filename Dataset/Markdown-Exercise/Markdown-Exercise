### Introduction

Walk up to any stranger and ask them to name three rock stars, *Beyonce*, *Taylor Swift*, and *Lizzo* would leap from their lips. Next, ask them to
name three architects. You'll see a bit of trepidation in their bodies as they will their brains to think of a response. For the uninitiated,
some guy named _Frank Lloyd_ something rolls off their lips, but no other names are uttered. Ask an architec-ture maven and the names Le
Corbusier, Ghery, and Hadid, and pop out with excitement and fervor.Before they became today's architect rock stars, there was one and they
all called him **Frank Lloyd Wright** (fig1).

Arguably, Frank Lloyd Wright is one of the most important and influential architects of the 20th century. Described by some as
narcissistic, arrogant, a hustler,and a charlatan.

Paradoxically described by others as confident, a visionary, and a skilled architect. Wright's duality casts
him as an incredibly polarizing figure. Author William Cronin said "Wright cherished his inconsistencies as if they were among his most
beloved creations \[Sic\] (Cronin).

Wright's lasting influence is the re-sult of having designed iconic buildings and residences. The SC Johnson building, NYC's Guggenheim Museum, The Robie
House, and Fallingwater represent some of his best works. His Organic Design philosophy can be experi-enced in his buildings. 
Open floor plans, large, expansive atriums flush with rays of natural light, and unique forms not seen before. In the home, Wright's philosophy
can be felt with its' integration of exterior and interior spaces, open floor plans, hand-built furniture, and home furnishings.

A fearless self-promoter, Wright rou-tinely aggrandized his accomplishments, skill, expertise, and relevance. He routinely ap-peared
on television (the social media of its' day) when it was in its infancy. He wrote books including his autobiography titled "Frank Lloyd Wright:
An autobiography." Additionally, he penned and published articles espousing his design principles for Ladies Home Journal and other
notable magazines.

####  Early Years

Frank Lloyd Wright was born on June 08th,1867, in Richland Center, Wisconsin to parents Anna Lloyd (neÃƒÂ© Jones) Wright (1838/39--1923) and
William Cary Wright (1825--1904) (Daniell, n.d.) (B, n.d.). Two of Wright's four siblings survived infancy and lived into adulthood.
Wright's mother, Anna, played a pivotal steering young Frank toward an architecture career. In a telling of his origin story, Anna proclaimed
Hailing from a large prominent Welsh family, The Lloyd-Jones was a tight-knit clan that espoused education, thrift, and religion. They were Unitarian.

Anna doted on her son. She wanted her son to become an architect having placed architectural objects in his crib. Additionally, she gave him a set of Froebel Blocks
to stimulate his creative inclinations (Nash, 2019). Froebel created a series of "playthings" to provide children with focused educational experiences.
Wright would later recount how the blocks helped him understand the concept of space and geometric forms.

William Carey (W.C.), Frank's father, also played a role albeit not as large as An-na's, in Frank's development. William often leaped from job
to job. He worked as a coun-try doctor, politician, lawyer, teacher, church organist, and itinerant preacher (B, n.d.). His love of music and religion influenced 
Frank's design philosophy. Additionally, William was a dreamer, a trait Frank would adopt. Frank's ability to dream big helped him accomplish amazing feats
in the face of insurmountable odds. In 1884, William divorces Ann and leaves the family. Frank despised him for leaving. He later added "Lloyd", his mother's family
surname, to his middle name in an act of maternal loyalty and solidarity. Anna and the Lloyd-Jones family endeavored to send Wright to university though they no longer
had William Carey's financial support.

Wright, aged 18, enrolled at the Uni-versity of Wisconsin in 1886. He majored in Civil Engineering because he couldn't afford to attend
architecture school (Nash, 2019). After two semesters, loaded with confidence and ready to take on the world, Wright left school early and
headed to Chicago, "The City of Big Shoulders." Not surprisingly, it was the closest large city to his beloved mother.
