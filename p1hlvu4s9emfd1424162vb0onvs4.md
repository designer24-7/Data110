> **BUILT** **ENVIRONMENT\]** **Concept** **Distillation:** **The**
> **Study** **of** **an** **Architect** **Report**

The purpose of this project is to become knowledgeable about the work of
an architect; as well as their philosophy on design.

**Select** **ONE** **architect** **from** **the** **list** **below**
**to** **RESEARCH** **AND** **WRITE** **ABOUT** **IN** **A**
**[4-5]{.underline}** **PAGE** **REPORT.** **Now,** **this** **is**
**an** **important** **decision!** **[You will use your architect as a
"GUIDE]{.underline}"** **throughout** **the** **semester** **as**
**you** **complete** **a** **series** **of** **exercises;** **and**
**ultimately,** **when** **you** **design** **your** **own**
**building** **during** **the** **second** **half** **of** **the**
**semester.** **So,** **choose** **wisely!** **Be** **sure** **to**
**select** **someone** **who** **inspires** **you** **to** **design**
**and** **think** **like** **them.** **This** **may** **require**
**some** **up-front** **research** **to** **make** **the** **best**
**selection!**

[Format]{.underline}: Your report must be typed, double-spaced using
Arial 12pt. font. Provide a title, the student's name, course name, and
date in the top right-hand corner. This section should NOT take up half
of the first page -- you are not fooling anyone by providing a ton of
empty space near the title or in between paragraphs (I was a student
once too!). The report must be written in **essay** **format** covering
the following topics (all are required):

**1)** **The** **Architect:**

Tell us a bit about your architect. What's their background? Tell us
about their upbringing. Where were they educated? Who did they
study/work under? What people/experiences/theories inspire(d) this
person to pursue architecture AND influence(d) the way they design?

**2)** **The** **Design** **Philosophy:**

Explain the design philosophy of your architect. What common themes,
principles, and ideas do we see throughout their work? What theories are
they known for? What are their core values? What are their
goals/aspirations?

**3)** **The** **Project** **-** **Objectively:**

Describe **[one]{.underline}** of your architect's projects in detail.
Try to focus on a small scale building. **NO** **SKYSCRAPERS** **OR**
**PROJECTS** **THAT** **CONSIST** **OF** **MORE** **THAN** **ONE**
**BUILDING!** Consider covering the following topics (you will learn all
the terms listed below in the next couple class periods):

> • Function of the Building (Commodity)
>
> o Explain the purpose of the building
>
> o What is the spatial organization? (grid, linear, cluster,
> centralized, radial) • Structure (Firmness)
>
> o Describe the structure of the building/ Describe the method of
> construction o Describe the main materials that were used
>
> • Aesthetics (Delight)
>
> o Describe how Axis, Hierarchy, Datum, Symmetry, transformation and/or
> Rhythm are used
>

> o Describe Colors, Textures, Shapes, and/or Patterns used in the
> design of the building • Describe the Impact of the Climate and Site
> on the design of the building
>
> o Is the building on a flat or steep site? Is it designed for a wet or
> dry climate? Did these factors influence any of the architect's design
> decisions?
>
> • Sustainable Design Features
>
> o What features are used? Is the building eco-friendly?

**4)** **The** **Project** **Experience** **-** **Subjectively:**

What was the intended experience of the building? What emotion was the
architect trying to evoke? What ideas did they want to convey? Were they
successful?? Share your opinion. How would you experience a building
like this? Is there anything that could be done to improve the user
experience?

**5)** **Images**

**Images** make reports much more clear and enjoyable to read! Do your
best to integrate images [within]{.underline} and
[throughout]{.underline} your report. The report needs to be five pages
[BEFORE the images are added.]{.underline} Consider which image and HOW
MANY will appropriately supplement the narrative of your report.
Consider sharing a variety of "views" including architectural drawings
like floor plans and diagrams.
